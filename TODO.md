# TODO:
## MUST haves:
1. ~~Create a method that holds the 3 choices for staff request and fills them to a table as they are selected.~~
- Note, I solved this by switching the variables to static.
2. ~~Create a method that searches the database based upon the parameters the customer gives.~~ 
- ~~Add location to database and search parameters~~
3. ~~Add a feedback label to every page.~~
4. ~~Publish site to make sure deployment will work.~~
5. Find a way to upload MDAC to the azure server.
6. Make the grid views update when ~~added, deleting,~~ editing
7. ~~Hide controls depending on staff level.~~
8. Make the update method for staff portal work properly.


## NICE to haves:
1. Make the front-end play nicely.
2. Fix the tables going to the left.
3. Make the javascript run before the server side code. We can call it from inside server code.
4. ~~Create a method that sends an email to the manager when a staff request is made.~~
5. Union tables so they look better, Contract only has 2 Columns.
6. Implement Client and Manager table, associate login
